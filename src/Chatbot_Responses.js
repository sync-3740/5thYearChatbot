    "Age": "As you grow older your blood pressure increases, this is due to a number of reasons such as: reduction in kidney function, less ability to rid the body of salt, hardening of the arteries.",
    "Sex": "Blood pressure (BP) is generally higher in men than in women regardless of age. In young adults (ages 18 to 35), high blood pressure is more prevalent in men than women. But after women reach the age of 50 (when most women lose their estrogen through menopause or removal of their ovaries), women have a higher prevalence of high blood pressure than men.",
    "Ethnicity": "It is known that there is a higher prevalence of hypertension in black populations. Hypertension related complications in black populations for example end stage renal disease. Also it is known that African Americans are generally more responsive to diuretic and calcium channel blockers than to ACE inhibitors or beta blockers.",
    "Obesity": "The greater the weight gain the greater the risk of high blood pressure. People who are obese have increased cardiac output (flow of blood from the heart) and increased peripheral resistance (resistance to the passage of blood through the arteries). There has been data shown that when people with high blood pressure lose weight, their blood pressure generally decreases.",
    "Weight": "For every 10-pound weight gain, the systolic blood pressure goes up 4 to 5 millimeters of mercury. Therefore, you don't have to be overweight or obese for weight gain to raise your blood pressure. Even a small weight loss can help manage or prevent high blood pressure.", 
    "Waist Circumference": "Central obesity where there is fat around the waist has been positively correlated with high blood pressure in several populations.",
    "What is blood pressure measured in?": "Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury, which is noted as mmHg.",
    "What is the procedure like?": "The cuff is wrapped around your upper arm and inflated until it feels tight, which limits blood flow to the rest of your arm. It can cause slight discomfort, but the tightness only lasts for a couple of seconds. The cuff is then slowly deflated, which lets blood flow return to normal. The sound of blood pulsing back into the arteries is used to measure blood pressure. If your doctor is using a manual monitor, they will listen to the sound with a stethoscope. An automatic monitor will inflate the cuff and take the blood pressure readings with just the push of a button.",
    "What do the blood pressure numbers mean?": "All blood pressure measurements include two numbers which are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). These numbers reflect the pressure against blood vessel walls when the heart contracts (SBP) and relaxes (DBP) every time it beats",
    "Can you give an example of a normal blood pressure measure?": "A typical blood pressure measurement may look like this: 120/80 mmHg, which is read as “120 over 80 millimetres of mercury”. The first number (120) is the SBP, and the second number (80) is the DBP",
    "Office BP": "Blood pressure measured in a clinical setting, like the hospital or your GP's office, is known as an office blood pressure measurement (OBPM). The steps for the procedure are shown below: 1. Patients should be seated comfortably in a quiet environment for 5 min before beginning BP measurements. 2. Three BP measurements should be recorded, 1-2 min apart, and additional measurements only if the first two readings differ by >10 mmHg. BP is recorded as the average of the last two BP readings. 3. Additional measurements may have to be performed in patients with unstable BP values due to arrhythmias, such as in patents with AF, in whom manual auscultatory methods should be used as most automated devices have not been validated for BP measurement in patients with AF. 4. Use a standard bladder cuff (12-13 cm wide and 35 cm long) for most patients, but have larger and smaller cuffs available for larger (arm circumference >32 cm) and thinner arms, respectively. 5. The cuff should be positioned at the level of the heart, with the back and arm supported to avoid muscle contraction and isometric exercise-dependant increases in BP. 6. When using auscultatory methods, use phase I and V (sudden reduction/disappearance) Korotkoff sounds to identify SBP and DBP, respectively. 7. Measure BP in both arms at the first visit to detect possible between-arm differences. Use the arm with the higher value as the reference. 8. Measure BP 1 min and 3 min after standing from a seated position in all patients at the first measurement to exclude orthostatic hypotension. Lying and standing BP measurements should also be considered in subsequent visits in older people, people with diabetes, and people with other conditions in which orthostatic hypotension may frequently occur. 9. Record heart rate and use pulse palpation to exclude arrhythmia. An example of how this looks is shown below:",
    "Home BP Measurement": "This is a method of measuring your blood pressure at home using a blood pressure monitor. It is able to give us better accurate readings compared to when it is checked at the clinic or at your GP.",
    "HomeVideoExplain": "Here is a brief video explaining this in more detail:",
    "Ambulatory BP Measurement": "This is a method of measuring your blood pressure is monitored for 24 hrs using a portable device. A small digital blood pressure monitor is attached to a belt around your waist and connected to a cuff around your upper arm.",
    "What is blood pressure?": "When the heart pumps blood around the body, the blood puts pressure on the walls of blood vessels. This is known as blood pressure.",
    "How is blood pressure measured?": "Blood pressure is measured with a blood pressure monitor (sphygmomanometer). There are two main kinds of blood pressure monitors: automatic and manual. Both machines use an inflatable cuff placed around your upper arm.",
    "How does my body affect blood pressure?": "Your body can affect your blood pressure depending on a number of factors, click on the ones listed below to find out more",
    "Sleep": "Blood pressure tends to drop when you sleep, then quickly increase when you awaken. Sleep deprivation increases blood pressure",
    "Respiration and Heart Rate": "Respiration and heart rate affect blood pressure.",
    "Mental and Physical Activity": "Mental and physical activity affect blood pressure.",
    "Smoking": "Smoking raises your blood pressure with each cigarette.",
    "Waste Excretion": "Defecation or a bladder full of urine may raise blood pressure.",
    "Alcohol": "Consuming more than two ounces of alcohol on a daily basis raises blood pressure.",
    "Low Blood Pressure Information": "Low blood pressure is known as hypotension. Naturally low blood pressure is unlikely to cause any symptoms and is normally nothing to worry about. But if your blood pressure drops too low, it can restrict the amount of blood flowing to your brain and other vital organs, which can cause unsteadiness, dizziness or fainting.",
    "Systolic BP": "Systole is the rhythmic contraction of your heart muscle when it pumps blood. During systole the chamber of the heart called left ventricle which is filled with blood contracts and pumps blood from the heart to the rest of the body.",
    "Diastolic BP": "Diastole is the period between heart beats. This is the time when the ventricle refills with blood from the lungs. Diastolic blood pressure is the lowest level your blood pressure reaches as your heart relaxes between beats.",
    "BP Variation": "Blood pressure is one of the most variable measurement, and this variability is due to a variety of reasons. Click on them below to find out more",
    "What is cholesterol?": "Cholesterol is a fat-like substance that is mostly made in the liver. It is carried around the body in structures called lipoproteins, which are “parcels” of fat and protein. The body needs cholesterol for its cells to function, but too much in the blood can lead to heart and blood vessel disease, which can contribute to heart attacks and strokes.",
    "What is high cholesterol?": "When you have too much cholesterol in your blood, this is called having a 'high cholesterol'. High cholesterol does not cause symptoms, but it causes changes inside the body without you knowing by clogging up arteries. Blood tests can find out whether you have a high cholesterol.",
    "Cholesterol and Diet": "Eating foods high in saturated and trans-fat can raise your cholesterol by increasing the amount of LDL in the blood. The more LDL in the blood, the more cholesterol is deposited into the artery walls.",
    "What are the different types of cholesterol?": "Lipoproteins can be divided into low-density lipoprotein (LDL) which contain more fat and cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) which contain very little cholesterol. Therefore, cholesterol is sometimes called LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, depending on how it is transported around the body.",
    "How do I lower my cholesterol?": "Eating a healthy diet with less saturated fat can help to lower your cholesterol. So can taking part in regular exercise, stopping smoking and limiting alcohol intake to less than 14 units a week.",
    "Cholesterol Medication?": "If you have changed your lifestyle and diet and your cholesterol levels are still high, then your doctor can prescribe certain medications. Statins are the most common medication and work by reducing the amount of cholesterol the body makes.",
    "About LDL cholesterol": "Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) carries cholesterol from the liver to the tissues, including to the walls of your arteries. As cholesterol builds up inside the artery walls, the arteries get narrower. Your arteries also get stiffer and they lose their ability to expand and contract along with the changing pressure of the blood being pumped from your heart. Because there is less space for blood to move through, blood pressure increases.",
    "About HDL cholesterol": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) helps to clear excessive cholesterol from the blood and carries it to the liver where it can be broken down and removed from the body, so it is called 'good cholesterol'.",
    "About Atherosclerosis": "Fat build-up in the arteries is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis literally means “hardening of the arteries”, making it harder for blood to travel to the different organs, including the heart and brain. Because LDL is a big contributor to atherosclerosis, it is called 'bad cholesterol'.",
    "What is hypertension?": "Hypertension is a blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg. Around a third of all adults in Scotland have hypertension, but because it does not usually have any specific symptoms many people don't know it. It is important to have your blood pressure measured by your doctor, or to monitor it at home. Even though hypertension doesn't cause any obvious symptoms, it increases your risk of developing heart and circulatory conditions, such as heart attacks or strokes.",
    "What causes hypertension?": "Most of the people with high blood pressure have primary or essential hypertension. This means their high blood pressure is not caused by an underlying disease. In most cases, there may not be one single cause, but rather several small causes which together cause a substantial risk of hypertension. These are known as risk factors, of which there are two kinds: modifiable and non-modifiable. Modifiable risk factors are things you can change. By making changes to your lifestyle, you can significantly lower your blood pressure. Some of these changes include: Decreasing the amount of salt and fat in your diet, Doing regular physical exercise, Losing weight, Stopping smoking, Decreasing your alcohol consumption.",
    "Secondary hypertension": "Some diseases, such as kidney disease and diabetes, can lead to higher blood pressure. This is known as secondary hypertension.",

    "Medicines": "Information on specific types of medication can be found by clicking any of the options below",
    "Differences for Women": "The main differences to consider if you are a women are listed below. Click on any of the options for more information",
    "Life Physical Activity": "Exercising regularly is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. In addition to helping with your weight, boosting your mental health, and even helping you sleep better, exercise also reduces your blood pressure and can reduce your risk of heart and circulatory diseases by up to 35%!",
    "Life Diet": "A healthy and balanced diet can help you lower and control your blood pressure, help with weight management, and decrease your risk of developing heart conditions. Try to make sustainable healthy changes to your diet. Crash diets aimed at losing weight rarely lead to permanent results and don't help you build healthy habits.",
    "Life Salt": "Salt, which is sometimes also called sodium, is necessary in your diet in small amounts. Too much of it, however, can affect your body and increase your blood pressure. Adults should eat no more than 6 grams of salt a day, which about one level teaspoon.",
    "Life Fats": "Alongside being present in commercially processed foods, fats are naturally found in lots of the plant- and animal-based foods that we eat.  Fats are good for the body in small amounts, as they are a great source of energy and our bodies need them to function properly. However, too many saturated fats can increase the risk of having heart attacks and strokes.",
    "Life Alcohol": "Drinking more than the recommended limit (14 units per week) can have serious effects on your health. Having more than three drinks in one sitting temporarily increases your blood pressure, but repeated binge drinking can lead to long-term increases and hypertension. People who have more than two drinks per day have an increased risk of high blood pressure compared with non-drinkers.",
    "Life Smoking": "It's widely known that smoking is very damaging to our health. Smoking causes about 90% of lung cancers, and it also causes cancer in many other parts of the body, including the mouth, throat, bladder, liver, stomach, and pancreas. But how does smoking damage your heart and circulation? More information about smoking can be found by clicking on the following options:",
    "Life Sleep": "Consistently getting less sleep can increase your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and even gaining weight. Lack of sleep can also affect the hormones in your body that make you hungry and keep you feeling full. Aim for 6-8 hours of sleep each night to maintain a healthy lifestyle and heart. It has even been found that having a couple of naps each week could decrease your risk of heart attacks and strokes.",
    "Aerobic Exercise": "Aerobic exercise means physical activities that get you out of breath. People often think about things like walking, running, cycling, or swimming. Regular aerobic exercise can help your heart health and over time you will find that you don't get out of breath as quickly as you used to.",
    "Resistance Exercise": "Resistance exercise, sometimes also called strength training, means exercises that strengthen your muscles. This can mean anything that works your muscles harder than your usual day-to-day activities: lifting weights or using cable machines at your gym, but also bodyweight exercises or training with resistance bands.",
    "Flexibility Exercise": "Improving and maintaining your balance with exercises like yoga or pilates helps you avoid falls and injury. Stretching your muscles can also improve flexibility, which will help you move easier during other forms of exercise, as well as your daily activities.",
    "How much should I exercise": "Try and aim for 150 minutes, or 2 and a half hours, of moderate intensity exercise per week. This is roughly the same as 75 minutes of intense exercise per week. It's better to exercise 20-30 minutes most days of the week, than to focus all of your exercise in a just a couple of days. This also helps you to get used to exercising regularly.",
    "Short Term Effects": "Smoking has immediate effects on your heart and circulation: smoking a cigarette instantly increases your heart rate and blood pressure.",
    "Long Term Effects": "Chemicals in cigarette smoke narrow and clog your arteries. This is because the chemicals make the walls more sticky and fatty material sticks to them more easily. This fatty material, also known as plaque, builds up and narrows the space in your arteries that blood can flow through. As the arteries continue to clog up, your risk of having a heart attack or stroke increases. The risk of blood clots is also increased.",
    "Lung Problems from Smoking": "Smoking is most commonly associated with diseases that directly affect the lungs, such as Lung cancer, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which incorporates bronchitis and emphysema, Pneumonia. Smoking can also worsen lengthen the symptoms of other conditions that affect your lungs, such as asthma, or respiratory tract infections like COVID-19 or even the common cold.",
    "Heart Problems from Smoking": "Smoking damages your heart and your blood circulation, increasing your risk of developing conditions such as Heart attacks, Strokes, Coronary heart disease, Peripheral vascular disease (damaged blood vessels).",
    "Fertility Problems from Smoking": "Smoking can reduce the fertility of both men and women. In men, smoking can cause impotence because it limits the blood supply to the penis. Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of complications such as Miscarriage, Premature (early) birth, A low birth-weight baby, Stillbirth.",
    "ACE Inhibitors": "Fantastic, what do you want to know about ACE Inhibitors?",
    "Angiotensin Receptor Blockers": "Fantastic, what do you want to know about Angiotensin Receptor Blockers?",

    "Diuretics": "Fantastic, what do you want to know about Diuretics?",
    "Beta Blockers": "Fantastic, what do you want to know about Beta Blockers?",
    "What are ACE Inhibitors?": "ACE inhibitors are commonly used to treat high blood pressure. They are also used to treat other conditions, such as heart failure, diabetes, kidney disease, and can be given after a heart attack to protect the heart. ACE inhibitors are sometimes used together with other antihypertensives, like calcium channel blockers or diuretics.",
    "ACE Inhibitors Warnings/Cautions": "Do not take ACE inhibitors if you are pregnant. ACE inhibitors are known to cause birth defects or loss of the unborn baby. If you are pregnant or plan to get pregnant speak to your doctor about receiving an alternative medication.",
    "How do ACE Inhibitors work?": "ACE inhibitors reduce the activity of an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). ACE creates a hormone, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II constricts the blood vessels, which makes them narrower and increases blood pressure. Angiotensin II also increases the reabsorption of water in the kidneys, which increases the volume of blood in the body. This increases blood pressure further. By reducing the action of ACE, ACE inhibitors reduce the amount of angiotensin II and, therefore, also the blood pressure increase caused by angiotensin II.",
    "What do I need to tell my doctor before taking ACE Inhibitors?": "Bring a list of your medications to your doctor to ensure that none of them interfere with ACE inhibitors. Also tell your doctor if you have previously had an allergic reaction to ACE inhibitors (swelling of the lips, eyes, throat, or neck). If you have previously tried ACE inhibitors and they had no effect on your blood pressure, it is important to tell your doctor this as well.",
    "What should I be aware of while taking ACE Inhibitors?": "Your kidney function will be monitored after starting an ACE inhibitor. You should check with your doctor before taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications, like ibuprofen or naproxen.",
    "Side Effects of ACE Inhibitors": "You might develop a dry, persistent cough when taking ACE inhibitors. This is a common but irritating side effect, so speak to your doctor about trying a different blood pressure medication. ACE inhibitors may also cause rarer and more severe side effects. If you experience any of the following after beginning your ACE inhibitor treatment, contact your doctor immediately. Severe allergic reaction, Swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat. As well as this an unusually fast heartbeat, dizziness and confusion, inability to urinate, a change in urination, or blood in the urine could be signs of a kidney problem. A bad stomach-ache, nausea, or throwing up, dark urine, light coloured stool, fatigue, yellow skin or eyes, throwing up, or lack of appetite could be signs of a liver problem.",
    "How are ACE Inhibitors best taken?": "Take the medication as prescribed by your doctors. This is usually either once a day (mornings) or twice a day (mornings and evenings).",
    "What do I do if I miss a dose of ACE Inhibitors?": "Try not to miss a dose, but if you do, take your missed dose as soon as you remember. If you remember your missed dose close to your next dose, do not take two doses - just take the next dose as usual.",
    "What are Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)?": "ARBs are commonly used to treat high blood pressure. They are also used to treat other conditions, such as heart failure, diabetes, kidney disease, and can be given after a heart attack to protect the heart. ARBs are sometimes used together with other antihypertensives, like calcium channel blockers or diuretics. ARBs work in a similar way to ACE inhibitors and are usually recommended if ACE inhibitors cause side effects.",
    "ARBs Warnings/Cautions": "Do not take ARBs if you are pregnant. ARBs are known to cause birth defects or loss of the unborn baby. If you are pregnant or plan to get pregnant speak to your doctor about receiving an alternative medication.",
    "How do ARBs work?": "Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) work by blocking the action of a hormone called angiotensin II. Angiotensin II binds to specific receptors in the body that are known as angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1). When angiotensin II binds to the AT1 receptor in the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys, it narrows the blood vessels and makes the body retain salt and water. Blood pressure increases because there is a larger volume of blood (water retention) moving through a smaller space (narrower blood vessels). ARBs block the AT1 receptors so angiotensin II can't bind to it, which reduces blood pressure.",
    "What do I need to tell my doctor before taking ARBs?": "Bring a list of your medications to your doctor to ensure that none of them interfere with ARBs. If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, do not take this drug. Tell your doctor if you have previously had an allergic reaction to ARBs (swelling of the lips, eyes, throat, or neck). If you have previously tried ARBs and they had no effect on your blood pressure, it is important to tell your doctor this as well.",
    "What should I be aware of while taking ARBs?": "If you have a cough due to an ACE inhibitor, an ARB can be given as an alternative medication. It is recommended to avoid taking both ARBs and ACE inhibitors. This can cause kidney problems and increase the levels of potassium in the blood. High blood potassium can lead to abnormally heart rhythms (arrhythmia) which could be fatal.",
    "Side Effects of ARBs": "ARBs tend to be well tolerated, but can cause dizziness, headaches, cold or flu-like symptoms, and fatigue. These side effects often improve after a few days as your body gets used to the medication. ARBs may also cause rarer and more severe side effects. If you experience any of the following after beginning your ARB treatment, contact your doctor immediately. Severe allergic reaction, Swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat. As well as this unusually fast heartbeat, dizziness, and confusion, inability to urinate, a change in urination, or blood in the urine could be signs of a kidney problem. Also, a bad stomach-ache, nausea, or throwing up, dark urine, light coloured stool, fatigue, yellow skin or eyes, throwing up, or lack of appetite could be signs of a liver problem. If you have severe diarrhoea and vomiting, continuing your ARB treatment can make you dehydrated, which affects your kidneys. Please speak to your doctor if this occurs.",
    "How are ARBs best taken?": "Take the medication as prescribed by your healthcare provider. It is normally taken once in the morning.",
    "What do I do if I miss a dose of ARBs?": "Try not to miss a dose, but if you do, take your missed dose as soon as you remember. If you remember your missed dose close to your next dose, do not take two doses - just take the next dose as usual.",
    "What are Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs)?": "There are two types of calcium channel blockers (CCBs): dihydropyridines and non-dihydropyridines. The dihydropyridine class of CCBs (listed in the table above) are used to relax blood vessels and help with high blood pressure. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs (drugs like diltiazem or verapamil) are used more commonly to treat abnormal heart rhythms. The information provided here is about dihydropyridine CCBs and their use in high blood pressure.",
    "How do CCBs work?": "Special muscle cells, like those in the blood vessels, need calcium to contract. The heart pumps blood around the body by contracting and relaxing, while the blood vessels regulate blood flow by narrowing (constricting) and widening (dilating). Calcium moves in and out of cells through tiny channels, which can be blocked by calcium channel blockers. This reduces the amount of calcium that helps muscle cells contract. As a result, the muscle is more relaxed. When the muscles in blood vessels (specifically arteries) relax, blood pressure is lowered.",
    "What do I need to tell my doctor before taking CCBs?": "Bring a list of your medications to your doctor to ensure that none of them interfere with CCBs. Tell your doctor if you have previously had an allergic reaction to CCBs. If you have previously tried CCBs and they had no effect on your blood pressure, it is important to tell your doctor this as well.",
    "What should I be aware of while taking CCBs?": "Grapefruit and grapefruit juice could interfere with your CCB treatment. It could make the side effects worse, so it's best to avoid grapefruit if you are taking CCBs. It is recommended not to drink grapefruit juice as this can increase the severity of side effects.",
    "Side Effects of CCBs": "CCBs work by relaxing blood vessels, which actually causes some of the drugs' minor side effects. These side effects include flushing and headaches, and usually ease off within a few days as your body gets used to the new treatment. Other common side effects include constipation and swelling of the ankles. Constipation can be improved by increasing the amount of fibre in your diet and drinking more water. Tell your doctor if you experience swollen ankles and they can switch you to a CCB that is less likely to cause this side effect for you. Rarer side effects include feeling sick or nauseous, dizziness, rash, high heart rate, and lethargy. If you have signs of a severe allergic reaction (swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), you should seek immediate medical attention.",
    "How are CCBs best taken?": "Take the medication as prescribed by your healthcare provider. It is normally taken once in the morning.",
    "What do I do if I miss a dose of CCBs?": "Try not to miss a dose, but if you do, take your missed dose as soon as you remember. If you remember your missed dose close to your next dose, do not take two doses - just take the next dose as usual.",
    "What are Diuretics?": "Diuretic drugs are used to lower blood pressure in hypertension and heart failure. They may also be useful in some kidney diseases or overdoses. Diuretics encourage diuresis, which is the increases passing of water in urine. Each type of diuretic drug differs slightly in how they work and how they are prescribed to lower blood pressure.",
    "Diuretics Warnings/Cautions": "Diuretic drugs tend to make you pass a lot more water than usual. Sometimes too much water and electrolytes are lost, which can cause severe health problems. Electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, and phosphate, are important minerals that your body needs to function. If you are experiencing diarrhoea or vomiting due to an illness, you should consult your doctor who may advise you to stop taking your diuretic medication until you feel better. This is to prevent you losing too much water and electrolytes. Do not take this medication if you are pregnant. This drug is known to cause birth defects or loss of the unborn baby. If you are pregnant, or plan to get pregnant call your doctor immediately to be prescribed an alternative medication which is suitable.",
    "How do Diuretics work?": "The kidneys regulate the amount of water and salt in your blood by excreting more or less of them in your urine. Where salt goes, water follows, so when your kidneys filter out more salt int your urine, you will be passing more water as well. Diuretics are called “water pills” because of the way they work: they increase increasing the amount of salt and water than you pass out in your urine. This reduces the amount of fluid in your circulation, which also reduces your blood pressure.",
    "The types of Diuretics?": "There are four types of diuretics: thiazides, thiazide-like diuretics, loop diuretics, and potassium-sparing diuretics. You can find out more about the different types by clicking the options below.",
    "What do I need to tell my doctor before taking Diuretics?": "Bring a list of your medications to your doctor to ensure that they do not interfere with your planned treatment and that they do not have any diuretic effects. Taking multiple diuretic medications could put you at risk of losing too many electrolytes or fluids. Tell your doctor if you have previously had an allergic reaction to diuretic medications (swelling of the lips, eyes, throat, or neck). If you have previously tried diuretics and they had no effect on your blood pressure, it is important to tell your doctor this as well.",
    "What should I be aware of while taking Diuretics?": "Given that diuretics make you pass more urine, you may have frequent visits to the toilet. If this is a problem in your day-to-day activities, you should discuss this with your doctor. It is likely that your dose can be divided and spread out through the day to interfere less with your activities.",
    "Side Effects of Diuretics": "Common diuretic side effects include: Thirst, Increased need to use the toilet, Dizziness when standing up, Skin rash (especially with thiazides), Stomach upset, Erectile dysfunction, Skin sensitivity to sunlight. Muscle cramps, nausea, headaches, and fatigue may all be signs that you are losing too many electrolytes in your urine. Tell your doctor if you notice that your urine output has decreased dramatically despite being on a diuretic. If you have signs of a severe allergic reaction (swelling of the lips, tongue, or throat), you should seek immediate medical attention.",
    "How are Diuretics best taken?": "Take the medication as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Try to take it at the same time every day.",
    "What do I do if I miss a dose of Diuretics?": "Try not to miss a dose, but if you do, take your missed dose as soon as you remember. If you remember your missed dose close to your next dose, do not take two doses - just take the next dose as usual.",
    "Thiazide Diuretics": "Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are the most commonly prescribed diuretics, and they are often combined with other high blood pressure medications. Thiazide diuretics have a weak action on the kidneys, so they may not make you pass as much urine as other types of diuretics. Thiazide diuretics also widen your blood vessels. Together these two effects work to lower your blood pressure.",
    "Thiazide-like Diuretics": "Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are the most commonly prescribed diuretics, and they are often combined with other high blood pressure medications. Thiazide-like diuretics work in the same way, although they have a slightly different chemical structure.",
    "Loop Diuretics": "Loop diuretics have a complex mechanism of action, which involves stopping your kidneys from absorbing electrolytes and triggering the release of certain chemicals by your body. The cascade of events eventually leads to passing more water and a lower blood volume and, therefore, blood pressure. Loop diuretics also widen your blood vessels.",
    "Potassium-sparing Diuretics": "Potassium, like sodium, chloride, and magnesium, is an electrolyte that your body needs in small amounts to function. Because diuretics cause you to lose electrolytes in addition to water, you may be at risk of losing too much potassium. Like their name suggests, potassium-sparing diuretics make you pass more water without depriving you of potassium.",
    "What are Beta Blockers?": "Beta-blockers are used to treat a variety of heart and blood vessel conditions to reduce frequency of chest pain (angina), prevent further heart attacks, control life threatening heart rhythms, heart failure and lower blood pressure. Beta blockers are sometimes also prescribed for anxiety, because they can help control the physical symptoms of an anxiety attack.",
    "Beta Blockers Warnings/Cautions": "Do not stop taking a beta blocker suddenly without consulting your healthcare professional.",
    "How do Beta Blockers work?": "Beta blockers work by making your heart beat more slowly and with less force. Because blood is pushed into your arteries with less force, there is less pressure on the artery walls.",
    "What do I need to tell my doctor before taking Beta Blockers?": "Bring a list of your medications to your doctor to ensure that they do not interfere with your planned treatment. Please let your doctor know if you have asthma, as beta blockers can make your asthma worse. You should also tell your doctor if you have been previously diagnosed with an unusually slow heartrate. Tell your doctor if you have previously had an allergic reaction to beta blockers (swelling of the lips, eyes, throat, or neck). If you have previously tried beta blockers and they had no effect on your blood pressure, it is important to tell your doctor this as well.",
    "What should I be aware of while taking Beta Blockers?": "Taking a beta blocker may increase your blood sugar levels, so if you have diabetes you may need to monitor your blood sugar closely. The dose of your antidiabetic medication might also need to be adjusted.",
    "Side Effects of Beta Blockers": "Common beta blocker side effects include: Dizziness, Headaches, Tiredness, Cold hands and feet, Vivid dreams (especially in older people).
